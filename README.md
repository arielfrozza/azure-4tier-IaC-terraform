## What will students learn in your course?
- You will learn to master Terraform in a Real-world perspective with 25 demo's on Azure Cloud with 20+ Azure Services and 30+ Terraform Concepts
- You will build Azure Virtual Network 4-Tier design with Subnets and Network Security Groups
- You will build infrastructure incrementally on Azure Cloud from simple VM to complex designs like load balancing across regions using Azure Traffic Manager with Terraform
- You will build Standard Load Balancer External and Internal with Inbound NAT Rules using Terraform
- You will learn and build Virtual Machine Scale Sets Manual and Autoscaling Profile concepts like default, recurrence and Fixed Time profiles with Terraform
- You will build Azure Public and Private DNS Zones using Terraform
- You will implement IaC DevOps usecase using Azure DevOps Build and Release Pipleines for your Terraform Configurations 
- You will build Azure Application Gateway usecases like Context Path Routing, Mutlsite Hosting, SSL, HTTP to HTTPS Redirect and AG Error Pages
- You will build a DNS to DB usecase with Azure MySQL Single Server with Virtual Network Rules and Service Endpoint concepts in Azure
- You will learn in detail about Terrafrom State, Local and Remote Backends. 
- You will learn and implement all Terraform Provisioners 
- You will learn and implement Terraform Modules with 2 types (Public Modules and Local Modules) and also publish a module to Terraform Public Registry
- You will implement Terraform Remote State Datasource concept for Load balancing across regions using Azure Traffic Manager and Azure Standard Load Balancer


## Are there any course requirements or prerequisites?
- You must have an Azure Cloud account to follow with me for hands-on activities.
- You don't need to have any basic knowledge of Terraform. Course will get started from very very basics of Terraform and take you to very advanced levels
- From Azure cloud perspective, also for complex topics like Standard Load Balancer, Application Gateway, Virtual Machine Scale Sets, we first implemnt via Azure Portal and then automate them via Terraform. 

## Who are your target students?
- Infrastructure Architects or Sysadmins or Developers who are planning to master Terraform from Real-World perspective on Azure Cloud
- Any beginner who is interested in learning IaC Infrastructure as Code current trending tool Terraform 
- Anyone who want to implement IaC DevOps on Azure DevOps using Build and Release Pipelines
